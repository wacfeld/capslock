- flowcharts look like this
- however parsing dotfiles is a pain 
- therefore we will use a simpler format, and then convert to dotfiles if we want a visual representation

- sth .sth . terminal interface to draw images, interactively do stuff, etc. like all those applications
    - ncurses? whatever the hell that is
    - like for example i want a photo of the flowchart in the background
